# Part 1: Program Design
This is where the engine of the accelerator is created. Depending on the organization's needs, accelerators can move fast and break things or run long and lean. Every specification needs to be tailored to the parent firm’s structure and future goals. In this section, we outline major design considerations when building an accelerator.

## Length 
[WP IMPORT: BLOCKQUOTE & CENTER JUSTIFY & ITALICIZE] “We discovered [the three-month program length] by accident. When we first started YC, we began with a summer program. We were trying to learn how to be investors, so we invited college students to come to Cambridge and start startups instead of getting summer jobs.” (Paul Graham, Interview DATE)

The 3 month program may have been discovered on accident but it helped create a new dimension of startup support that leverages the time constraint. While the most public accelerators (Y Combinator and Techstars) have chosen the 3 month approach, organizations should design their programs according to the type of product they are focusing on and the amount of capital they have available. 

### Considerations for Program Length: Type of Product
[WP IMPORT: BLOCKQUOTE] “What is perhaps most important is that the programme is long enough that startup founders can develop a demo product and be able to pitch it by the end of the programme. As seed accelerators expand outside of web applications, this will become even more difficult to achieve within the 3-month window. While writing a web application can be done in just a few months, if the company requires a physical product to be built the time required before a true demo is ready will be much longer. Even at Y Combinator, typically only half to three-quarters of the startups funded are able to launch before the programme Demo Day. New programme founders should specifically think about the reasons behind the length of their accelerator programme. Copying Y Combinator without a reason is a poor choice.” (Jed D. Christiansen - Report) 

[WP IMPORT: BLOCKQUOTE] “Most of the existing accelerators to date have operated in the software or mobile applications arena, an industry characterized by relatively low capital requirements and short prototyping durations.”  (SBA, Report)  

[WP IMPORT: BLOCKQUOTE] “...But we kept the 3-month cycle because it is a good length of time to build a version 1. Some startups may not be able to launch in such a short time, but they should all be able to build something impressive.” (Paul Graham, Interview)
